<p>That runt wants a war? He is gonna get one. </p>
<p>The distant siren blaring keeps looping inside my head. I have been very hungry for the last couple of days, so hungry that I havent even thought about food. I wanna eat, without feeling guilty that is. I think my real hunger is for good food, the food that I have refused over all these years. I hope I can get some in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Wire is a very good series. Top notch writing, insane acting and excellent setting. Man I love rewatching that shit, in blue ray. Will probably watch some other classic, might not watch the Sopranos this time.</p>

<p>In other news, women are idiots. Who woulda thunk. Jokes aside, my expectations from people is surely driving me mad. Every action makes me think if it's really worth it. Relationships are exhausting. Lots of decisions makes you question your own self identity. The fear of losing your own self, the fear of losing a part of my life, the fear of actually progressing in life. Men fail in the simplest things because it is fear that is the great equalizer. Fear. Fear. Fear. Fear rules us and will rule us all. I don't wanna be afraid no more. Fear is not my style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't wanna die. I have seen the other side, I know what awaits, I know the void better than I know myself. Maybe someday the abyss will be someone stranger to me.</p>
