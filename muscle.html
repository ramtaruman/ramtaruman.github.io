<h4>How to gain weight ? (CICO)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can only gain weight (fat/muscle) when you are in a caloric surplus. Eat more and gain weight. Also sleep for minimum 8 hours. Drink water too.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 style="text-align: left;">But sir, I eat a lot and I still dont gain jackshit !</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>You are overestimating the amount you are eating. Psychology has a big influence on eating and hence makes it hard for many people to eat more even if they are eating less unless they are used to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>I dont wanna get fat! I wanna be big but I wanna be jacked !</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Be in a weightlifting routine which has a high volume split.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>I wanna get strong! I dont care about being fat.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow a powerlifting routine with high frequency and eat a lot. Looks arent a good indicator of strength since muscles are usually hidden by fat.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>I am working out a lot but cant seem to get big or see any increase in my strength!</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Eat more and sleep more.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>I dont have access to gym/weights.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow a bodyweight routine. You will progress slower since progression isnt linear and stalls early.</p>
