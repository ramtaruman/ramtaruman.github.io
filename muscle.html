    How to make all kinds of gainz and stuff

    There is no way set in stone which will help you reach your goals in muscle building. Its usually a good thing to keep
    consistent with whatever works for you, considering how different people respond differently to different stimulus.
<br><br>
    There are few things to keep in mind and consider, namely : Volume, Diet and Recovery.

    Volume
</h2>
<p style="font-family:'Verdana';color:whitesmoke" >
    Most people fail to incorporate enough volume into their training which bottlenecks their growth. Its usually best to have
    atleast muscle groups being trained atleast twice a week, thrice if you can take it.
    <br><br>
    Different training program can facilitate huge volume being incorporated into your plan. A basic PPL plan allows you hit
    every muscle twice a week while the A-B split type routines allows you ti hit them like, thrice a week.
    <br><br>
    Too much volume can make recovery an issue and fatigue can creep onto your later training sessions, hampering your performance.
    So it's important to find the sweet spot which will work for you.
