<h2 style="text-align: center;">THE WIRE : A Review of the Modern Epic</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>~ by Prakhar Sengupta</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first five season of "The Wire" on HBO has been one of the great achievements in television artistry, a novelistic approach with very intricate and detailed storytelling. It has never flinched from ambition -- dissecting a troubled American city, Baltimore, as well as and certainly more truly than any history book could have. It has tackled the drug war in this country as it simultaneously explores race, poverty and "the death of the American working class," the failure of political systems to help the people they serve and the tyranny of lost hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet, the curse of "The Wire" and the thing that makes its creator, David Simon, nearly apoplectic, is the notion that "The Wire" is difficult and dense and hard to follow if you haven't been there from the start. Simon, perhaps the best writer in all of television -- a label one should not toss around lightly -- has a point when he jokingly suggests that critics who love the series should temper the part about it being difficult to jump into. That scares away viewers. It makes people believe he's forcing them to eat their vegetables on a cable channel that offers brilliance in other packages, some of them a whole lot easier to swallow -- like "Entourage," for example.</p>
<p><em class="ii">The Wire</em> is an epic poem in the Western Tradition that reveals the absence of justice in modern American political economy. <em class="ii">The Wire </em>is about two worlds: one ruled by<strong class="hq ij"> Force </strong>and the other by <strong class="hq ij">Cunning. </strong>Sometimes the two are in conflict, sometimes congruent, but both operate without <strong class="hq ij">Justice </strong>as an organizing principle.</p>
<p id="6e7e" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">This epic begins, as most do, in the middle of the action, after the Barksdale criminal drug organization has won a war to dominate the drug trade in West Baltimore. It begins with a dead man, &ldquo;Snot Boogie&rdquo;.</p>
<p id="609c" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">Detective McNulty articulates the simple injustice that a man christened Omar Isaiah Betts by his mother would be called &ldquo;Snot Boogie&rdquo; for the rest of his life because one day he had a cold. In epic poetry, the utterance of your name ensures fame throughout time, it ensures your immortality. Your name is your rep. Forever.</p>
<p id="8e7b" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">Snot Boogie&rsquo;s friend tells Detective McNulty that Boogie used to rob the dice game every week. He would then get caught, get beat up, and that was that. But, the friend continues, &ldquo;the mother fucker didn&rsquo;t have to put a cap in his ass, coulda just whooped him like we always do&rdquo;. The friend concedes that he and Boogie live in a world of violence, that <strong class="hq ij">Force </strong>is the organizing principle, with nothing but personal whim to contain it. It is a world of <strong class="hq ij">Force </strong>without <strong class="hq ij">Justice</strong>. The man with an unfair name would have received &ldquo;a whooping, like always&rdquo;, but instead he was shot.</p>
<p id="5252" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">For the real modern horrors are born in the bureaucracies, in the world of <strong class="hq ij">Cunning</strong>, as C.S. Lewis wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="ii">The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid &ldquo;dens of crime&rdquo; that Dickens loved to paint. It is not done even in concentration camps and labour camps. In those we see its final result. But it is conceived and ordered (moved, seconded, carried, and minuted) in clean, carpeted, warmed and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voices. Hence, naturally enough, my symbol for Hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or the office of a thoroughly nasty business concern.&rdquo; â€• C.S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters</em></p>

<p id="d4c9" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">&nbsp;</p>
<p id="22d3" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">Before he is shot by Slim Charles, gangster Cheese rants, &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no back in the day, there is just the Street and the Game and what happens here today.&rdquo; In other words: there is no <strong class="hq ij">memory</strong>, no <strong class="hq ij">justice</strong>, and therefore there is no learning, only an endless cycle of retributive violence and the exercise of <strong class="hq ij">Force</strong>.</p>
<p id="4b04" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">Homer is the teacher of the Greeks because he taught them that men of Force and men of Cunning will lead you to death. If a society wishes to undertake a democratic strategy for governance, it should first know whom <em class="ii">not</em> to elect. Justice will always out, <em class="ii">and The Wire</em> shows us what it power it has to destroy when a civilization does not use it as a first, organizing principle.</p>
<p id="4581" class="ho ic ap by hq b hr hs id ht hu ie hv hw if hx hy ig hz ia ih ib eo" data-selectable-paragraph="">No Justice, no Peace.</p>
